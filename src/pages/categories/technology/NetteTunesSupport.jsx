          Due to ongoing legal proceedings and family matters from 2009, CINCOâ„¢ Corporation 
          is required to inform users that expansion songs must be purchased separately. 
          This is not related to any specific events or persons (especially Lynn) and 
          should not be discussed during Funk Barn playback. The Jeff GoldBluMan Group 
          maintains no opinion on these matters.
