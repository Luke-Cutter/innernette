  How This All Started & Why
</h2>
<p>This was a passion project that started during winter break of my senior year at Champlain College. I was back at home in South Carolina bored out of my dome watching Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! for the third or fourth time. I saw the Innernette™ and my mind immediately began racing. I knew I could make it. I fired up my desktop and immediately began planning, conceptualizing, and building. This is not the first iteration. This is probably the 4th or 5th restructure of the Innernette™, showing the importance of thoughtful planning and organization. I made the majority of the non-picture assets: including banners, page-designs, and icons. This is the Figma link to those assets! https://www.figma.com/design/NC7UrVuayMj8ACmW8m0FHr/Tim-and-Eric-Assets?node-id=0-1&t=TkdUF2fLnmMhmAUe-1</p>
</br>
<p>This was an incredible Figma and React learning experience, and I hope to finish it shortly to get it on my domain: innernette.site!</p>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
